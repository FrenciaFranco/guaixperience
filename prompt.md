Replace all 4 current mock sections in this landing page with real content for a barbershop brand called “GUAI XPERIENCE”. Keep the same overall visual style, animations, and layout structure of the template (dark background, glowing lines, section transitions, cards/buttons), but replace the placeholder titles, subtitles, descriptions, labels, and CTA text with barbershop-specific content.

Brand concept:
GUAI XPERIENCE is not just a haircut. It is a sensory experience where style, self-care, and connection with nature come together. The tone should feel premium, modern, welcoming, and slightly poetic (but still clear and professional).

Replace the 4 mock sections with these sections (in this exact order):

1) Welcome / Hero section
Title: “Welcome to GUAI XPERIENCE”
Subtitle/description: Explain that this is a sensory barbershop experience, not only a haircut; a place to relax, reconnect, and leave renewed.
Primary CTA button: “Book Now”
Secondary CTA button (optional): “Learn More”
If there is a floating side label, rename it to something relevant like “Welcome” or “Experience”.

2) The GUAI Experience (brand/story section)
Title: “The GUAI Experience” (or “Our Essence” if it fits better)
Description: Expand on the idea of personalized care, attention to detail, relaxing environment, and connection with nature.
If this section contains cards/items, replace them with barbershop-relevant highlights such as:
- Personalized Attention
- Sensory Atmosphere
- Premium Grooming
Keep the existing card layout and interactions.

3) Visit Us / Location + Contact section
Title: “Visit Us in Barcelona”
Include:
- Address: C. Llull 82, Barcelona
- WhatsApp: 654 823 296
- Phone: 931 286 182
- Instagram: @guaixperience
If possible, make buttons for phone/WhatsApp clickable (tel: / wa.me format) and Instagram clickable.
If there is a side label, rename it to “Contact” or “Location”.

4) Booking CTA section (final conversion section)
Title: “Book Your Appointment”
Description: Short CTA inviting users to choose a service and book online in a few steps.
Primary button text: “Book Now”
Button URL:
https://connect.shore.com/bookings/guai-xperience-70005040-06e6-4d38-9633-6d5187dc93d5/services?locale=es
Optional small helper text under button: “Fast and secure online booking”
If there is a side label, rename it to “Booking”.

Important implementation notes:
- Do NOT change the main design language, animations, or section mechanics.
- Do NOT add generic corporate tech copy.
- Make all text barbershop-specific and aligned with the GUAI XPERIENCE concept.
- Keep the content readable over the animated background (adjust contrast/opacity if needed).
- Preserve responsive behavior for desktop and mobile.
- Return the final updated JSX/TSX content for these sections and any changed text constants/data arrays.
